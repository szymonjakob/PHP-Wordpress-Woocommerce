<h1>Repository of useful PHP code snippets for Wordpress & Woocommerce</h1>
This repository is my collection of snippets that I use to create simple and individual solutions for creating wordpress / wocommerce based websites.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
To get things work just copy and paste function/filter code into functions.php file of your childtheme/theme.

<h2>Advantege of using hooks</h2>
The biggest advantage of this solution is that it does not directly affect the template files of the wordpress theme. It's injection ðŸ’‰
